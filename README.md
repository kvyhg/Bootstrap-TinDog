# Bootstrap-TinDog
This repository showcases a project I built as part of my Full-Stack Web Development learning journey. 
The primary focus of this project is to explore and effectively use Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework for creating responsive and mobile-first web designs.

# About This Project
This project was completed following the guidance of the Full-Stack Web Development [Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy. 
It is designed to demonstrate the practical application of Bootstrap components and utilities in a real-world setting.

# Technologies Used:
HTML5: To structure the content of the project.
CSS: For custom styling where necessary.
Bootstrap: For building responsive layouts and leveraging ready-made UI components.

Iâ€™d like to thank Dr. Angela Yu for their clear and practical teaching approach, which made learning Bootstrap both accessible and enjoyable.
